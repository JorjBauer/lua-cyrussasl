Two spaces to a tab.

I put braces on the same line as their 'if', but not on the same line as 
function definitions or structs/enums.

Functions which are not for use outside of a module are named
starting with underscores. While it is safe to say that the definition

	void _func()

should actually be 

	static void _func()

the reverse is not necessarily true - a function could be destined to
be called from outside this module via a dispatch table. For example,
the function

	static int cyrussasl_get_username(lua_State *l)

is for direct consumption by Lua, but via a dispatch table. (It is not
for consumption by other C methods directly, which is why I have
attributed it static.)
