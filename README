Cyrus SASL library for Lua 5.1+

**************************
Installation instructions:
**************************

0. Install Cyrus SASL.

1. Install LuaRocks.

2. # sudo luarocks install lua-cyrussasl 
   (which will download and install from luarocks.org); or 

   # sudo luarocks make
   (if you've downloaded from git and want to build/install from local
   source)

3. Enjoy.

If you're not using luarocks, then you can try directly editing and
using the (deprecated, unmaintained) Makefile. You'll need to comment
out the architecture blocks that don't pertain to your platform. This
Makefile was originally written for MacOS 10.5 and Debian Lenny;
LuaRocks is much more flexible.

*****
Bugs:
*****

* Prompts aren't implemented in the client functions.

* Server/Client first is essentially hard-coded (it's server-first).

* It's not clear that encode/decode are useful as implemented (and
  tests do not cover encode/decode).
