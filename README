**************************
Installation instructions:
**************************

0. Install Cyrus SASL.

1. Edit the Makefile. You'll need to comment out the architecture blocks
   that don't pertain to your platform. (As of this writing, this package 
   works on MacOS 10.5 and Debian Lenny. This will likely function on 
   other platforms as well, but I have not explicitly tested on them. If you 
   have a Makefile configuration that works on another platform, send me 
   email with your configuration so that I may include it in a future 
   verison.)

2. make

3. sudo make install

4. Enjoy.


*****
Bugs:
*****

* Does not contain any client-side functionality. To be added; should
  not be difficult, now that the general architecture is in place.

* To install this properly, you must edit the Makefile. This should be 
  abstracted into autoconf (or something lighter weight to accomplish the 
  same thing).

* There is no test suite. I have some unit tests I've been using for
  pieces of this code, but the harness isn't good enough for me to
  include it as part of the package yet.

* Installation has been tested under MacOS 10.5 and Linux
  (specifically, Debian Lenny). Other platforms should be tested.

* Use of stack offsets is not consistent. Not technically a bug
  (things work) but it makes sense to me that I should go back through
  and make sure that everything's consistently using negative offsets
  to reference stack elements.
